### Taxonomy of _Phythoptora ramorum_
> Clade: 	SAR \
Phylum: 	Oomycota \
Order: 	  Peronosporales \
Family: 	Peronosporaceae \

There are 4 clonal lineages:

EU2 - Europe 2
Note: Name based on origin and time of isolation 

### Host range:\
> Notholithocarpus densiflorus -> tanoak \

* I need more details of number of species 

Evidence suggest that _P. ramorum_ spreads from nurseries to forests.
